This folder contains all data for the fish regeneration project. 

Copy of fish_regen_mastersheet_wound closure_necrosis - mastersheet.csv contains primarily wound closure data. 
  - Variables included are coral_id, date_collected, date_fragmented, fish, wound, tank, notes, wound_close, and necrosis. 
    - coral_id: The numerical id of each unique coral specimen
    - date_collected: The date the coral was collected YYYYMMDD
    - date_fragmented: The date the specimen was fragmented YYYYMMDD
    - fish: This variable denotes whether the coral was housed with fish (1) or without fish (0)
    - wound: This variable describes which of the three wounds the coral specimen received: large (2), small (1), and none (0)
    - tank: This variables describes the tank that the coral was in. There are six tank options (1-6)
    - notes: This variable contains text about substitutions or other misc. topics
    - wound_close: This variable denotes whether or not a coral specimen was fully healed by the end of the 21 day experiment (yes, no) NA values are assigned to corals which had no wound. 
    - necrosis: This variable denotes whether or not a coral specimen experienced necrosis during the experiment (yes, no) 

coral_delta.csv contains data for the change in buoyant weight values for corals in the fish regen project. 
    - Variables included are date, coral_id, buoyantweight_g, air_temp_c, air_weight_g, fresh_temp_c, fresh_weight_g, salt_temp_c, salt_weight_g, density_aragonite, wound, fish, density_stopper, density_sw, dry_mass, coral_vol, dry_mass_delta, vol_delta
        - date: This variable denotes the date that the data were collected YYYYMMDD
        - coral_id: The numerical id of each unique coral specimen
        - buoyantweight_g: This variable denotes the measured weight of each coral specimen when submerged in seawater
        - air_temp_c: This variable describes the air temperature when the data were collected (degrees Celsius)
        - air_weight_g: This variable describes the weight of the calibrating object in grams
        - fresh_temp_c: This variable describes the temperature of the freshwater that the calibrating object was measured (degrees Celsius)
        - fresh_weight_g: The weight of the calibrating object when submerged in freshwater in grams
        - salt_temp_c: The temperature of the saltwater that the calibrating object was submerged in (degrees Celsius)
        - salt_weight_g: The weight of the calibrating object when submerged in saltwater in grams
        - desnity_aragonite: the density of the aragonite plug (g/cm^3)
        - wound: This variable describes which of the three wounds the coral specimen received: "Large", "Small", or "No Wound"
        - fish: This variable denotes whether the coral was housed with fish ("Fish") or without fish ("No Fish")
        - density_stopper: The density of the calibrating object (g/cm^3) as calculated in (buoyant_weigth_analysis.Rmd)[https://github.com/haydenvega/fish_code/blob/main/buoyant_weight_analysis.Rmd]
        - density_sw: The density of saltwater used when collecting the data (g/cm^3)
        - dry_mass:
