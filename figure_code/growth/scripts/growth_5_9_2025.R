# ===============================
# NOTE TO HAYDEN
# ===============================
# This script performs an allometric analysis of coral growth using buoyant weight measurements.
# It filters and reshapes initial and final weights, merges in tank metadata, 
# tests for initial mass differences across treatments, fits an allometric mixed-effects model 
# (log-log), and evaluates treatment effects (fish and wound) on allometrically scaled growth 
# using likelihood ratio tests.

# ✅ Next Steps:
# 1. Incorporate **time** and **surface area** into the growth metric to reflect standardized
#    growth per day per surface area — consistent with Pete Edmunds’ approach.
#    The formula will be:
#       (final - initial) / (surface area × time)
#    which gives a rate in **mg/cm²/day**.
#
# 2. For surface area:
#    - Use **wax-dipped surface area estimates**.
#    - Apply the **dowel calibration curve**.
#    - Subtract **wound area** from total surface area for a corrected estimate.
#
# 3. Once that’s calculated, rerun the same analysis (Sections 5–7) with this new growth response.
#    That includes:
#    - Visualization of raw and scaled growth.
#    - Allometric adjustment (if needed).
#    - Statistical testing (lmer and likelihood ratio tests).

# ===============================
# 7. Visualize Scaled Growth Across Treatments (Faceted by Wound)
# ===============================

#to HV: 
# Here’s why we use log(final_mass / initial_mass^b) as our “growth_scaled” metric:
#  1. Allometric baseline:  M_final ≈ a * M_initial^b
#     – b tells us how mass‐gain scales with starting size.
#     – Dividing by initial_mass^b “removes” size‐dependent expectations.
#  2. Log transform both sides:
#       log(M_final) – b*log(M_initial)  =  log(M_final / M_initial^b)
#     – Turns the power‐law into a straight line (easier for linear models).
#     – Makes symmetric interpretation of under‐ vs. over‐performance.
#  3. Interpretation:
#     – A value of 0 means “grew exactly as predicted for its size.”
#     – Positive: grew more than expected; Negative: grew less.
#
# So growth_scaled = log(final_weight / initial_weight^b) is our
# size‐corrected, statistically robust growth metric.
#To AS: THIS MAKES SO MUCH SENSE thank you for the explanation!
