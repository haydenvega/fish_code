Randomization code for difference in photo as a function of wounds

```{r}
null_photo_dist <- replicate(1000, {
  photo_means <- pam_healed %>% 
    mutate(wound = sample(wound, n())) %>% #this shuffles the selection of data
  group_by(wound) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(fv_fm))

 diff_means <- photo_means$mean[2]-
  photo_means$mean[1]
 
 diff_means
})

ggplot(tibble(null_photo_dist), aes(null_photo_dist)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, 
                 color = "cornflowerblue", 
                 fill = NA)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = diff_means, 
             color = "firebrick")
```
